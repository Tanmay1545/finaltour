              <p>
                Budget Your Trip is designed to help you plan a better vacation
                by gathering travel costs for various destinations around the
                world. Whether you're traveling on a shoestring budget, or
                looking to splurge on a luxury resort, our website will help you
                understand how to get the most for your money.
              </p>

              <p>
                We offer travel planning resources that you can use to estimate,
                plan, and track your travel budget. Our information and
                resources are <strong>free of charge</strong> for travelers. If
                you're in the beginning stages of planning your trip, you can
                <a href="https://www.budgetyourtrip.com/search.php"
                  >search for your destinations here</a
                >, find your favorite place, and see what others have spent on
                low-end, mid-range, and luxury trips and vacations.
                Alternatively, you can select a country from the
                <a href="#countrylist">list of countries</a> to find out what
                the typical mid-range travel costs are for that area. The costs
                are broken down by category and include everything from
                accommodation, to food, entertainment and transportation
                budgets. These destination budget pages also give you an
                overview of what to expect in your chosen country, things to see
                and do, how to best get around, and what you can expect from the
                local cuisine. From a country page, you can dive deeper into
                specific cities, too. This information is designed to be used as
                a starting point for you as you begin deciding where to go and
                how much you need to save.
              </p>

              <h6>Who We Are</h6>
              <p>
                All of our information comes from travelers just like you. All
                of the average daily travel costs are calculated from travel
                budgets that have been provided by real people who have already
                visited these locations. This way, you can get a realistic
                perspective on what you might spend. Our numbers are constantly
                updated to ensure that you get the most up-to-date information.
                If you register on our website (free) you can use our travel
                planning tools to help you plan your own budget before your trip
                even begins. You can break down your estimated expenses by
                category and see graphs and charts of where your money will
                likely go. Learn which cities and countries will have the
                greatest impact on your trip expenses, and rework your route to
                ensure that you get the most bang for your buck.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then, once your trip begins, you can track your budget to make
                sure you don't overspend. Whether you're going on a one week
                holiday, or a one year odyssey, it helps to know that you're not
                spending more than you have saved. By tracking your budget on
                this website, you'll also be helping other travelers. If you
                notice your destination of choice is missing from our list,
                track your trip costs on our website and help future travelers.
                Your expenses will be added to our estimates, and as our data
                grows, so does our comprehensiveness and accuracy.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is a tool that is created by travelers, for travelers. We
                understand how important budgeting is to a trip. Guidebooks may
                offer some budgeting advice, but information is often
                out-of-date, difficult to locate, and limited in its value. This
                website is supported by a community of travelers who want easy
                accessibility.

              <p>
                Many travelers become overwhelmed when they begin planning their
                trip. If you're going on vacation for a few weeks, it's hard to
                narrow down your choices to one or two countries. If you're
                taking time off of work for a gap year, planning your route can
                get overwhelming to say the least. Whatever type of trip you're
                planning, you should first narrow your options down by region.
                Some parts of the world are more expensive than others, but
                within regions there is a lot of variability as well. You can
                also check out our

              <h6>Narrowing Your Options</h6>
              <p>
                The region or countries you decide to visit will dictate how
                much money your trip will require. It's best to understand costs
                before you begin your trip, so you know exactly what to expect
                from your destinations of choice.
              </p>

              <p>
                Asia in particular has countries that range from super
                expensive, like Japan, to very low cost, like India or Nepal.
                Southeast Asia is well known as an affordable destination for
                those on a limited budget, but if you want a high end vacation,
                there are plenty of resorts in Thailand as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Africa can be surprisingly expensive for first time visits.
                Depending on your country of choice, the selection of hotels can
                be limited, restaurants may be overpriced, and safaris can
                quickly eat away at your budget. Still, you'll find plenty of
                affordable places to go in this vast continent. Ethiopia is an
                unexpected surprise for visitors who want to see a different
                side of Africa. Morocco is Africa with an Arab twist, and Kenya
                is probably your most affordable option if you're hoping to do a
                safari.
              </p>

              <p>
                South America is another region that is reasonable in cost. Some
                countries, like Brazil, may quickly eat away at your budget, but
                others, like Bolivia, are perfect for those with limited
                financial options.
              </p>

              <p>
                In Europe, you'll quickly find that your money goes a lot
                farther in the Eastern European countries than it does in the
                Western European countries. Still, prices can be quite high all
                over, so it's good to learn a few tricks, like couchsurfing, to
                ensure that your finances stay in check.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're headed to North America, national parks and small
                towns are usually the least expensive options. Consider
                traveling with a tent and you'll save yourself a lot of money.
                While hostels are few and far between, campgrounds are abundant,
                particularly near the most popular parks like the Grand Canyon
                and Yosemite. In Mexico, head inland and you'll find many more
                affordable choices than you would on the coast where luxury
                resorts are abundant.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Caribbean Islands are not a popular option for independent
                travelers. You'll rarely find a backpacker spending time in the
                region, but if you're looking for a comfortable vacation with
                all the amenities, then you've found the right place to go.
                Despite the high costs, or perhaps because of them, it is
                important to understand which islands offer the best deals for
                cost conscious travelers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Central America is a small region, but it has a lot to offer. It
                is a great introduction to a new culture, and your budget can be
                kept to a minimum. Still, if you're looking for a resort, you
                don't have to look far as there are many diverse places to stay
                in this fascinating area.
              </p>

              <p>
                Many people shy away from the Middle East, but those that make
                the trip are greeted by a welcoming culture, friendly people,
                and a one of a kind experience. Countries are diverse in style,
                culture, and costs, so it's best to do your research ahead of
                time and choose places that will fit your travel style to ensure
                your trip is all that you hoped.
              </p>

              <p>
                Australia and New Zealand are no longer budget destinations, but
                backpackers still flock to the area. By planning ahead and
                looking for the best deals you can ensure you get the most out
                of your trip.
